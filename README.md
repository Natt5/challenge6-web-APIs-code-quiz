# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Web Development Web Quiz

## Description

This project is a timed coding test with an emphasis on the principles of JavaScript. It's a browser-based interactive application using JavaScript-powered dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This test attempts to mimic code evaluations that are frequently seen in interviews in order to improve your knowledge and skills in these kinds of formats.

### Motivation

The goal is to give prospective front-end engineers and students at coding boot camps a tool to quickly assess their level of JavaScript understanding. This task involves putting the knowledge from this lesson into practice, which will help you become ready for actual coding exams.

### Specific Features

Interactive Test Interface: An easy-to-use test featuring a start button that launches the timed test.

Multiple-choice questions have a dynamic question presentation where they emerge one after the other.

Timed Responses and Scoring: The quiz concludes when all questions are answered or the allotted time runs out. Wrong answers incur a penalty.

High Score Tracker: This tool lets users track their performance and compare it to that of their colleagues by storing their scores with initials.

### Technologies Employed

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## User Story

"AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers."

## Usage

With only one click, users may launch the quiz, select their JavaScript question answers, and get their scores. The user experience is seamless on a variety of devices thanks to the straightforward UI.
